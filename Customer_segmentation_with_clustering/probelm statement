# Project 5: Customer Segmentation with Clustering üõçÔ∏è

**Project Objective:** To use unsupervised machine learning to identify distinct groups of customers within a mall's dataset. By segmenting customers based on multiple dimensions (income, age, spending habits), we can provide rich, actionable insights to the marketing team for highly targeted campaigns.


### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **Unsupervised Learning:** Understanding the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
2.  **Clustering Fundamentals & K-Means:** A deep dive into how the K-Means algorithm works.
3.  **The Elbow Method:** A critical technique for finding the optimal number of clusters (`k`).
4.  **Multi-dimensional EDA:** Exploring relationships between all features using 2D and 3D plots.
5.  **Multiple Segmentation Models:** Building and interpreting different clustering models based on different feature sets.
6.  **Hierarchical Clustering:** A brief introduction to an alternative clustering method.
7.  **Data-Driven Personas:** Translating cluster statistics into actionable business strategies.
