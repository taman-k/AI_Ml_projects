# Project 2: In-Depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Netflix Content Analysis ðŸŽ¬

**Project Objective:** To perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the Netflix dataset. We will explore trends in content production, identify popular genres, analyze content ratings, and understand the distribution of movies and TV shows on the platform. This project builds on foundational EDA by introducing time-series analysis and more complex data cleaning and transformation techniques.

**Class Duration:** 2.5 hours

### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handling missing values and converting data types (especially dates).
2.  **Time-Series Analysis:** Analyzing how content has been added to Netflix over the years.
3.  **Text Data Manipulation:** Parsing and analyzing columns with multiple values, like `listed_in` (genres) and `cast`.
4.  **Geographical & Rating Analysis:** Understanding where content comes from and its maturity level.
5.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, insightful features like 'content age'.
6.  **Advanced Visualization:** Creating insightful plots to understand distributions and relationships in the data.
