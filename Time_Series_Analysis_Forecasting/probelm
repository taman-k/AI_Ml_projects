# Project 6: Time Series Analysis & Forecasting ðŸ“ˆ

**Project Objective:** To build a time series model to forecast the number of airline passengers for future months. This project provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to time series analysis, from data decomposition and stationarity testing to building and evaluating ARIMA and SARIMA models.

**Class Duration:** 2.5 hours

### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **Time Series Fundamentals:** Understanding the components of a time series (Trend, Seasonality, Residuals).
2.  **Stationarity:** Learning what stationarity is, why it's crucial for many models, and how to test for it (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test).
3.  **Data Transformation:** Applying techniques like differencing and log transforms to make a series stationary.
4.  **Model Identification:** Using Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to determine model parameters.
5.  **ARIMA Modeling:** Building a baseline ARIMA model for forecasting.
6.  **SARIMA Modeling:** Extending ARIMA to build a powerful SARIMA model that explicitly handles seasonality.
7.  **Forecasting & Evaluation:** Making predictions and evaluating model performance.
