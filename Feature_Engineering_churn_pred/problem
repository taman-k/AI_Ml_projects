Feature Engineering for Customer Churn Prediction 
# Project 7: Feature Engineering for Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“¡

**Project Objective:** To demonstrate the power of feature engineering by building and comparing two models: a baseline model with raw features and an enhanced model with newly engineered features. The goal is to accurately predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.


### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **The Importance of Feature Engineering:** Understanding why it's often the most critical step for model performance.
2.  **Advanced Data Cleaning:** Handling tricky data types and inconsistencies in a real-world dataset.
3.  **Feature Creation Techniques:**
    - **Binning/Discretization:** Grouping continuous variables into meaningful categories (e.g., tenure groups).
    - **Combining Features:** Creating new features by aggregating or interacting with existing ones (e.g., total number of services).
    - **Simplifying Categories:** Making features easier for models to interpret.
4.  **Building a Modeling Pipeline:** Using Scikit-Learn's `ColumnTransformer` for robust preprocessing.
5.  **Model Comparison:** Quantitatively measuring the performance lift gained from our engineered features.
