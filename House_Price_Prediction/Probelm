# Project 3: House Price Prediction (Regression) üè†

**Project Objective:** To build a regression model that accurately predicts the sale price of houses based on a large number of features. This project will cover the complete machine learning workflow, from deep EDA to advanced preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.


### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **Regression vs. Classification:** Understanding the goal of predicting a continuous value.
2.  **Target Variable Analysis:** Analyzing the distribution of `SalePrice` and applying transformations (log transform).
3.  **Advanced Data Preprocessing:** Implementing robust strategies for handling missing values in both numerical and categorical features.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, powerful features from the existing data to improve model performance.
5.  **Categorical Encoding:** Differentiating between and applying Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
6.  **Model Building:** Training and comparing a simple baseline model (Linear Regression) with an advanced model (XGBoost).
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Understanding and using key regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, R-squared).
